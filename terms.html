    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">1. Platform Role</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      ELIMAN is a technology platform that connects customers with independent workers.
      ELIMAN does not employ workers and is not responsible for work performed by them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">2. Independent Contractor</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      By using this platform, you agree you are an independent contractor, not an employee,
      agent, representative, or partner of ELIMAN. You are fully responsible for your taxes,
      insurance, tools, transportation, and business expenses.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">3. Liability & Risk</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      You work at your own risk. ELIMAN is not responsible for injuries, damages,
      property loss, accidents, legal claims, or disputes. You are responsible for your
      own insurance and safety.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">4. Job Acceptance</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      You may accept or decline any job. ELIMAN is not responsible for cancellations,
      customer behavior, or job conditions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">5. Payments</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Workers are paid after job completion. ELIMAN may apply service fees. Fraud or
      misconduct leads to suspension.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">6. Indemnification</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      You agree to indemnify and hold ELIMAN harmless from claims, lawsuits,
      damages, injuries, legal fees, or losses arising from your work or actions.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      By agreeing, you confirm you understand these Terms and accept all responsibility.
    </p>
